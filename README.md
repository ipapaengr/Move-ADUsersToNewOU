This PowerShell script moves Active Directory (AD) user accounts to a new Organizational Unit (OU). It takes a list of user IDs from the file "IDs.txt" and moves each user to the OU specified by the variable "$targetOU".

The script uses the Get-ADUser cmdlet to retrieve user information and the Move-ADObject cmdlet to move the user account to the new OU. If an error occurs during the move operation, the script will catch the error and log it to the "moved.csv" file.

To use the script, create a file named "IDs.txt" in the same directory as the script and add the user IDs that you want to move, one per line. Then modify the "$targetOU" variable to match the target OU in your AD environment.

The output of the script is a CSV file named "moved.csv" that logs the result of each move operation. The file includes columns for the user's SamAccountName and the result of the move operation (either "OK" or an error message).
